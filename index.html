    All human activity is prompted by desire. There is a wholly fallacious theory advanced by some earnest moralists to the effect that it is possible to resist desire in the interests of duty and moral principle. I say this is fallacious, not because no man ever acts from a sense of duty, but because duty has no hold on him unless he desires to be dutiful. If you wish to know what men will do, you must know not only, or principally, their material circumstances, but rather the whole system of their desires with their relative strengths.

     The exhibit “The Old Strategy Calendar” depicts the strategy management schedule at a typical large company. The process starts about midway through the fiscal year, when the CEO and the executive team get together to clarify their strategic vision and update the strategy. Sometime afterward, similar processes take place at the business and functional units, led by unit heads and other senior executives. Toward the end of the third quarter, the finance function takes the baton, finalizing corporate and unit budgets. At the end of the year, the HR function conducts employees’ annual performance reviews and orchestrates the setting of professional goals and development programs. Throughout the year, meanwhile, different teams and units have engaged in performance reviews, corporate communication, and knowledge sharing.

    The African river martin (Pseudochelidon eurystomina) is a perching bird, one of two members of the river martin subfamily of the swallow family, Hirundinidae. First described by German zoologist Gustav Hartlaub in 1861, the African river martin was not at first recognised as a swallow, but was later placed in a separate subfamily shared with the Asian white-eyed river martin.
